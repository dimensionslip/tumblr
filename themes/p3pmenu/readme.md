## About
Theme #01, aka the product of leafing through Tumblrâ€™s custom theme documentation and being extremely anal for the past few days. Intended to be a simple follower tribute for one of my other blogs.

This theme comes in two pre-customized flavors, MC and FeMC. You could also make your own color combinations, as I have made the colors customizable in the theme proper, among other things detailed below.

Installation instructions are under the cut. Please like or reblog if you plan to use this theme, and I hope you enjoy it! c:
