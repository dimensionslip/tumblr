##Theme Installation Instructions:

1. Go to Tumblr’s customize page.
2. Click on Edit HTML.
3. Clear the editor and copy-paste the code there.
4. Click Update Preview + Save (or just Save).
5. Refresh the customize page and begin customizing!

Note: If you are experiencing some problems regarding your old theme’s colors or images getting carried over, delete all the <meta> tags in the header. By <meta> tags, I mean the text that comes between {/block:Description} and &lt;style type="text/css"&gt;. Delete that, save, refresh, copy-paste the code again, save, refresh, and you should be good to go!

Also, if that does not work, then do the following instead:

1. Switch to this theme first: http://www.tumblr.com/theme/36037
2. Copy-paste everything under RAW Paste Data in the pastebin code into the HTML Editor of the customize page.
3. Save.
4. Refresh the customize page.
5. Start customizing.
