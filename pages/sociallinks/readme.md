## About
This is the first page I’ve coded from scratch for Tumblr, and with that said, I do hope you like it!

It’s a relationships/family page, ideal for roleplay blogs. Though of course, it also works nicely as a family page.

It was more or less inspired by various aspects of the social link screens present in Persona, as implied by the name. Clicking on the cards at the left side to jump to certain sections of the text, namely the respective arcana represented by each image.

I tried to make the code self-documenting, but if you have any questions regarding the code, feel free to drop by my inbox!
