# Tumblr
This repository contains Tumblr-specific customizations, including my custom themes and pages. These said customizations are available under the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International License.

##Terms of Use:

* **DO NOT REMOVE THE CREDIT.** This means keeping the credit in the source code intact, as well as the credit link on the page itself. You may move the credit link to another part of the page, but it should remain visible at all times.
* **DO NOT RELEASE OR CLAIM AS YOUR OWN.** This should be self-explanatory.
* **DO NOT USE MY CODE AS A BASE TO MAKE YOUR OWN.** Tumblr’s documentation on custom themes plus a good knowledge of HTML and CSS can more or less net you an equivalent of that.
* **DO NOT REPOST THE GRAPHICS USED IN THE THEME.** Feel free to use them if you are using the theme it came from, but otherwise, do not repost them in any manner.
* **YOU MAY LIGHTLY/HEAVILY EDIT THE CODE, BUT NOT REMOVE THE CREDIT AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE IT.** You are free to make full use of the customization options available—it is why I made them, after all—but no matter how much you tweak it and/or the base code, you are not allowed to redistribute the code in any manner.

*Themes and pages have been tested with the latest versions of Firefox and Chrome, as well as IE10.*

##Before asking any theme or page-related question:

* Make sure you have the latest version of the theme/page installed.
* Make sure that your question has not been answered in the corresponding support tag.
* Do not ask me about adding music to the themes provided. While I could go on and on about the reason why, let’s just leave it at the fact that it goes against my personal values system as a web developer on and off Tumblr. I might consider adding support for music players in future themes, but it is admittedly somewhat unlikely.
